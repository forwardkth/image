I made a simple iOS App as the remote UI controller UI of my WifiRobot last week. It is simple and not looks so nice. I will try to make it better later.
The communication is based on TCP protocol. I am considering to build it like a general App for all kinds of Wifi Robot projects.
You can do the commands configurations and modify the video streaming address to fit your robot design.

There is a demo video below:

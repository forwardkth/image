I would like to show my computer workspace here. I have one DELL notebook which connected with two monitors running Linux as well as windows.

The small Thinkpad ultrabook is from my company. You can see my second generation tele-operation robot on the left desk. The desk on the left is not shown completely  in the photo. It is 2.5 meters long.
I use it as my hardware  workbench and build it like a home Lab. I bought most of my electronic  elements, hardwares, tools and equipments from China. You know how about the price of those things in EU.

I spent a lot of my spare time  here working with my intereting personal projects including robots, sensor based  systems and  sensor networks. This is a good way to go through the 6 months long dark winter of Sweden.

Filco Ninja Majestouch-2 Tenkeyless Tactile Action UK Keyboard

I bought this mechanical keyboard from the UK website 'thekeyboardcompany'. I received the package today. It is a very nice programmer keyboard with high quality. I am very satisfied with it. 

In the beginning, I don't know which swtich I should choose, especially the brown switch or the blue switch. Frankly speaking I prefer the blue switch. Because I hear the type sound from youtube. The blue one let you type faster and feel more clear. But considering the noise and other people around you, finally I chose the brown switch one. This is also recommanded by a google engineer. Another good thing I like this keyboard is the front face printing design. I have an old logitec keyboard. All the printing characters are gone or not clear after five years'use. The new keyboard overcomes this problem completely by priting nothing on the top. That is clever. The only thing is that it is a little expensive. It cost me 1700 SEK. But the similer keyboard from the same OEM producer only cost you half. I think between 600 SEK to 800 SEK can be a reasonable price.

Anyway I like this keyboard and feel happy when typing my code under linux. (by the way, it takes about 5 mins to start to work after I plugged in the usb cable... Before that,I thought this keyboard did not support linux system)

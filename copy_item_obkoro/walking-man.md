## Description:

This is the first project in my life when I was still a young undergraduate student in China. 
In the winter holiday of 2007, I cooperated with my friend, Hou, who is from China Academy of Art to create this visual art work of new media. It is a 3D LED lamp matrix controlled by a very cheap 89C52 MCU. They compose the dynamic image of a walking people in 3D space.

The following links are the excellent libraries you can use for the beaglebone development. Pybbio is based on Python. Libbulldog is for java. And BlackLib employs the power of C++. Maybe Lua in the future?

It seems like the script languages are more and more popular for the embedded system. I think it will be more easier as the embedded platform is more and more powerful. I would like to try all the following three libs on my beaglebone robot and compare the performances. My robot is using Pybbio. And i am working with BlackLib now.
